ML-Based Movie Recommendation System

## Description: 
meta-filmclub is a coding project that utilizes machine learning (ML) to generate personalized movie and TV show suggestions for users based on their Letterboxd history, metrics, preferences, and popular/good titles. 

The system incorporates user-rated films, watchlist, genre preferences, and offers the option to adjust recommendations based on user ratings' correlation with a film's Rotten Tomatoes and/or IMDb score/rating.


## Key Features:
1. User Profile Analysis: Analyze the user's Letterboxd history, ratings, and watchlist to create a comprehensive user profile.
2. Movie/TV Show Recommendation Engine: Develop an ML-based recommendation engine to suggest relevant titles based on the user's profile and preferences.
3. Genre Preference Recognition: Implement algorithms to recognize the user's preferred genres and incorporate them into the recommendation process.
4. Popularity and Quality Consideration: Use popularity metrics and Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb scores to suggest popular and critically acclaimed titles.
5. User Feedback Integration: Allow users to provide feedback on recommended titles to improve future recommendations.
6. User-Adjustable Correlation: Offer an option for users to adjust the importance of their ratings' correlation with Rotten Tomatoes and/or IMDb scores in the recommendation algorithm.


## Best Coding Languages:
Python is well-suited for this project due to its extensive ML libraries and data processing capabilities. For web-based interaction, Python web frameworks like Flask or Django can be utilized.


## Basic Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Collect user data from Letterboxd, including watched films, ratings, and watchlist.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to create a structured user profile, genre preferences, and movie attributes.
3. ML Recommendation Model: Develop an ML model (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) to generate personalized movie and TV show recommendations.
4. Popularity and Quality Metrics: Incorporate popularity metrics and Rotten Tomatoes/IMDb scores as features in the recommendation model.
5. User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interface where users can view personalized recommendations and adjust correlation preferences.
6. Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to rate the recommended titles and provide input for future recommendations.


## Basic I/O Details:
meta-filmclub will be accessible through a web-based platform. Users can log in with their Letterboxd credentials to allow the system to access their film history, ratings, and watchlist. The system will then present personalized movie and TV show recommendations on the web interface, along with options to adjust the correlation preferences.



meta-filmclub aims to enhance the movie-watching experience for users by providing tailored and high-quality recommendations based on their individual preferences and ratings. Through the power of ML, users can discover new and exciting titles that align with their cinematic tastes, making it a go-to platform for movie enthusiasts and cinephiles.
